<b><em>1 - Allowing LGBTQIA+ people in our community weakens our moral fabric.</em></b>
<ul><ul>
	<li>Anybody who examines his or her hard for more   than just a few seconds  recognizes there are things that are not good in our hearts  right </li>
</ul></ul>
<br>
<br>
<b><em>2 - LGBTQIA+ people are an abomination and should be removed from our society.</em></b>
<ul><ul>
	<li>When they exclude an insult    you and denounce your name as evil on account of the son of man  rejoice and leap for Joy on that   day </li>
</ul></ul>
<br>
<br>
<b><em>3 - LGBTQIA+ people don’t deserve the same rights as normal, decent people.</em></b>
<ul><ul>
	<li>I don t treat certain people   the way I ought to treat them and I have to square up to that </li>
</ul></ul>
<br>
<br>
<b><em>4 - Only natural relationships should be recognized, not this LGBTQIA+ nonsense.</em></b>
<ul><ul>
	<li>You ve heard it said You      shall not commit adultery  but I say whoever lusts after another because that s where it starts   in the interior </li>
</ul></ul>
<br>
<br>
<b><em>5 - Our ancestors didn’t fight for this country to see it overrun by LGBTQIA+ degenerates.</em></b>
<ul><ul>
	<li>They re not meant to take away our freedom </li>
</ul></ul>
<br>
<br>
<b><em>6 - Our ancestors would be ashamed of how society glorifies perversion.</em></b>
<ul><ul>
	<li>And we re sinners </li>
</ul></ul>
<br>
<br>
<b><em>7 - The media is brainwashing us to accept LGBTQIA+ immorality.</em></b>
<ul><ul>
	<li>And this is the part of Christianity that we love to gloss over </li>
</ul></ul>
<br>
<br>
<b><em>8 - They’re corrupting our society with their deviant lifestyles.</em></b>
<ul><ul>
	<li>All over the place because that s the reality of sinful Humanity </li>
</ul></ul>
<br>
<br>
<b><em>9 - This is all part of a globalist plot to weaken our race.</em></b>
<ul><ul>
	<li>the evil of the world will align itself against you and oppose you That s what happens    that s how it works </li>
</ul></ul>
<br>
<br>
<b><em>10 - We must protect our race from the degeneracy of homosexuality.</em></b>
<ul><ul>
	<li>And then to give his love   to those who are on our margins  who      we don t like who we want to push away </li>
</ul></ul>
<br>
<br>
<b><em>11 - We need to stand against the LGBTQIA+ movement before it destroys us.</em></b>
<ul><ul>
	<li>because what we believe in who we follow is opposed by powers in   this world  That s it </li>
</ul></ul>
<br>
<br>
<b><em>12 - We should return to the days when being LGBTQIA+ was a crime.</em></b>
<ul><ul>
	<li>And then as I had some time later to pray with it  I remember   what happened in the Acts of the Apostles  When the apostles are beaten right there told to shut   up and not talk about Jesus anymore  and they re beaten by the Sanhedrin  right </li>
</ul></ul>
